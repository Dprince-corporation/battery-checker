                    Almost all smartphones available in the market use lithium batteries. The issue with these batteries is that they degrade overtime affecting both the <b>Total Capacity</b>, and <b>Recharge Cycle</b> Now that all phones offer lot's infomations regarding batery usage, there is no native way to monitor battery degradation. But with this site that's not the case, here 2 or 3 things are require from you, to calculate your battery comsumption overtime. 
                    <b> (1) Total Capapcity of your device battery, (2) how many months you have be using your device or (3) how many years you have used it</b>.

            <p>
                The idea that lead to the creation of this website, i was just sitting at the desk, facing my laptop screen, thinking about how phone, laptop battery is draining so fast after 1 year of usage, so am like is there not a way to monitor battery degradation?, then i asked Google, i found answer related to (windows battery-report using: [powercfg /battery-report]). So i started thinking about the logic behind it. after days of thinking googling stuff, i got the idea if total capacity is given the the rest can be calculated using algorithm, that's how i decided to try it in <b>JAVASCRIPT</b>.
